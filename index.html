                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/NCRBanner.png" alt="">
                <p>Let me start by saying that the people I worked with at NCR were incredible! Everyone was very
                  welcoming, helpful, and a joy to work with. Especially during our WFH stage!<br></p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">This page will go over my third Co-Op work term at NCR in Waterloo, Ontario. I worked with familiar technologies this work term which allowed me to solidify my understandings of procedures in an agile environment as well as strengthen my problem-solving skills. This post should give you insight on specifics of what I learned during my 8 months at NCR.
                </p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Employer Info</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">NCR, also known as National Cash Register, is a banking solutions company and is an American based company. They work with banks to develop technologies to make the banking experience smoother for both the customer and the teller. NCR Created the first cash register. </p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Job Description</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">I worked at NCR as a software engineer. I was assigned to the R&D team where I implemented many features to improve a teller’s experience when scanning cheques and adding items to bank deposits. I worked with a variety of technologies such as ReactJS, Angular, Jest, Crucible, and JIRA. I improved my understanding of ReactJS the most as I spent 7 of the 8 months working with it in an agile environment.
                  I primarily developed new features with Angular and ReactJS. Afterwards, I would make unit tests to make sure my code had the desired output using Jest. I also helped plan sprints during weeklong sprint planning meetings. Towards the end of the work term, I worked with the QA team to ensure other developer work was working without unexpected functionality. Later in the last 4 months of my work term, I was able to help a new Co-Op get up to speed with how things are done at NCR and give direction.
                  </p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Goals</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">My main goal for this work term was to work on my time management skills. I worked from home for around 6 months with no supervision. To make sure I did not lose productivity, I wrote down my tasks for each day and what work I still needed to accomplish. This helped me visualize the work I would be doing and kept me on track. 
                  Independent work was another goal that I improved on this work term. I did not want to heavily lean on teammates for answers when using new technologies. During my time working from home, I was able to distance myself from asking questions until I was completely stuck on an issue and had spent a considerable amount of time on the issue. This drastically improved my problem-solving skills and my confidence to produce quality work. 
                  My final goal was to become proficient in ReactJS. I had recently worked with the language in my last Co-Op but I had not fully grasped the concepts and flow of the language. After working for 7 months with ReactJS, I can say I am very confident in my ability to solve issues using the language.
                  </p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Overall, I believe I achieved all my goals. This work term has offered invaluable experience and the people I worked with were amazing! Everyone was very welcoming and open to questions. They were patient and provided a great learning environment where I could produce quality code on a live project.</p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Acknowledgments</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">I had a great time working for NCR during my last 8 month Co-Op. I learned more than I could have hoped and spent it with an incredible team. Sara Bullock was the best person on the team I worked on. She helped every step of the way when needed and was always available for a call, be that work or personal. Fise, Shalini, & Amardeep. I did not work as closely with you all as I would have liked but all of you took the time to make sure I was uninhibited and able to do my work with a smile. </p>

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Web Application Developer (2nd Co-Op)</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/pmBanner.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Let me start by saying that the people at Postmedia I/O were incredible! Everyone there was extremely
                  welcoming, helpful, and a joy to work with.<br></p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">This page will be going over my second Co-Op work term at <a href="http://www.postmedia.com/">Postmedia I/O</a> in Kitchener, Ontario. This work term was my first developer experience outside of school. I learned many important skills such as team collaboration, time management, and a plethora of technical skills that I will talk about later. This post should give you insight on what I learned and how I grew as a software engineer through my 4 months with Postmedia.</p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Employer Info</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Postmedia I/O is an innovation outpost that is creating a place for company's top view their ad campaign tracking analytics all in one place. Their goal is to take google, Facebook, and other big tracking company's data and compile it into easily readable data. They work closely with the consumers to insure that the data they pull in is what the consumers believe to be 'crucial'.</p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Job Description</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">I was assigned to the order form builder team where I primarily worked on the front-end side of things. My job included daily stand ups, 2 week sprints, and working closely with others to deliver quality improvements and features to the platform.</br></br>I worked with many new languages and frameworks through my work term such as React, Redux, JavaScript, Typescript, and NoSQL databases. I worked with JavaScript to create data migrations that added more options to specific fields on the form builder. I was also tasked with re-engineering JavaScript to TyperScript. I often worked with React and Redux to create functionality and track order status as well as user activity. I was sometimes put in charge of making sure our sprints made it into production by deploying our work from development. I was tasked with making NoSQL database queries to find and sort data as needed. Lastly, I often created JIRA tickets to improve or create new functionality that would be useful for the product.</p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Goals</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">My main goal for this work term was to have changes I made make it to production and not slow down my team. To do this, I made efforts to increase my reading comprehension skills, team collaboration skills, and become proficient in all the technologies I was tasked with using. These goals are goals I plan on continuing to improve on throughout my career as a software developer.<br><br>Team collaboration is about knowing when and how to help others on your team and to keep up with what your team is working on. This was achieved through daily stand ups, conversations within slack, and biweekly demo/retro meetings. It wasn’t uncommon for someone to run into an issue in which another team member had recently encountered and was able to solve. This really helped with keeping pace and making sure the product was progressing.<br><br>I was able to increase my reading comprehension skills a fair amount. I was able to clearly follow existing code and figure out what it was connected to, what it did, and how to use it to my benefit. I was also able to increase my understanding of React, Redux, and Git.</p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Over all, I believe I had a very successful work term. Especially since I enjoyed every second of working at Postmedia I/O! This was my first development experience outside of school and the skills and knowledge I gained are invaluable. I believe i have emerged from this work term a new and improved version of my past self. This was an amazing experience and cannot thank everyone at Postmedia I/O enough!</p>

                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">This will be an explanation of my first Co-Op work term at <a
                    href="https://www.vidyard.com/">Vidyard</a> in Kitchener, Ontario. This was my first Co-Op work term
                  and it helped me gain a greater understanding on how software companies function and how to work as a
                  team. This post should give you insight on what I learned and how I grew as a software engineer over
                  the 4 months I was at Vidyard.<br>
                </p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Employer Info</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.vidyard.com/">Vidyard</a> is a Marketing software
                  company. Their goal is to help businesses succeed through the power of video. They created their own
                  software that allows sharing videos and tracking video analytics extremely easy and have integrated
                  the software with many other companies. They even have their own <a
                    href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-and-webcam-recorde/jiihcciniecimeajcniapbngjjbonjan">video
                    making chrome extension.</a> They pride themselves on having the best customer service/experience a
                  company can offer. The company has been around for about 7 years. Vidyard is partnered with many big
                  companies such as <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.pardot.com/">Pardot</a>, <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/ca/">Salesforce</a>,
                  and many others.<br>
                </p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Job Description</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">I was hired onto the Technical Support team which was part of customer
                  experience. I was tasked with learning the software vidyard was selling and assisting customers with
                  any techinical issues they may have.<br><br>I often reported bugs that customers were experiencing
                  through JIRA. I was also constantly monitoring <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a>, a
                  ticketing system that allowed users to report their issues to my team and allowed us to help guide the
                  users through their concerns. Later in the Co-Op, I helped customize simple sharing pages with
                  HTML/CSS and ran a couple ruby scripts to make mass changes to users accounts.<br><br>Once I got used
                  to my new duties, I started taking calls with customers over the phone and <a
                    href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> to help solve their issues faster and more efficiently. I had
                  learned my way around Salesforce, HubSpot, Pardot, JIRA, Zendesk, and many other softwares.
                </p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Goals</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">My main goals when starting my first Co-Op job were to learn how to work
                  better as a team, learn better troubleshooting steps, learn how to communicate more effectively with
                  others, learn a multitude of new software, and above all else, I made sure to show that I am a
                  dedicated and hard worker. These goals are not just the goals for my first work term but the goals
                  that I plan on improving throught my entier career as a software engineer.<br><br>Part of working
                  better as a team is also communicating more effectively. I learned how to do both at the same time. I
                  often wrote reports and updated knowledge articles to improve the resources that not only our team
                  would end up using but also our clients. These articles had to be clear and concise so that our
                  clients were not confused. I also made sure to ask if anyone needed help when running low on work to
                  also inform my team of potential problems that users have started reporting.<br><br>I learned how to
                  more effectively troubleshoot issues while working at Vidyard. I did this by asking questions and
                  gathering as much information as possible and starting at the beginning of any issue until I rooted
                  out the problem. This way, I knew I wasnt missing anything. I learned that the solution to any problem
                  is in the details of the situation and to learn as much as possible with quick, concise, and effective
                  questions when trying to test and debug software.<br><br>I believe I made great progress in learning
                  new widely used software. I learned how to use JIRA effectively which I know will be important to know
                  in my future careers.<br>
                </p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Vidyard was my first Co-Op and my time there was invaluable. I gained so
                  many new experiences and all of them had a lesson inside and helped me grow. The people there were
                  amazing and the job was very insightful on how a software company operates. I believe I have come out
                  of my position a stronger worker and a more valuable team member. I could not have picked a better
                  place as my first Co-Op!
                </p>
                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Acknowledgments</h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Everyone at Vidyard deserves a spot on this page as they were all very
                  helpful but I would like to give a special thanks to my team. <a

                  was extremely hard working and very helpful and easy to talk to as we were both new to the team. She

                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-broughton-32a9616/">Chris Broughton</a> was an absolute
                  treat to work with. Although I only worked with him briefly, as he changed teams half way through my
                  Co-Op, he was always working with a smile on his face. <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-jantzi-69019780/">Jordan Jantzi</a>, JJ, was an

                  the team after me but was quick to learn everything and was always making others laugh with her bright

                    Ahmed</a> was an outstanding team member. He helped me throught out my entire Co-Op. Not only did he
                  help me with difficult problems and interesting clients, but he also taught me a great deal on the
                  foosball tables. Thank you all for the amazing Co-Op!</p>
